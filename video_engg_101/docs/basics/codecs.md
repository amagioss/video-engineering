# enCODECode -> CODEC

The Codecs are compression technologies with two components: an en**CO**der to compress the video file and a **DEC**oder to decode the compressed video file. As nifty capitalization suggests, codec is a contraction of the terms “encoder” and “decoder.”

### H.264

The world lives on H.264 and it is also known by the name AVC (Advanced Video Coding). H.264 is typically used at up to HD (1080p) resolution, although it can extend beyond 1080p. 
The "H" in H.264 comes from the H-series recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T), which defines standards for audiovisual and multimedia systems. The "264" is simply the identifier assigned to this particular standard within the H-series.
There is also H.262 (MPEG-2 Video), which was prodominantly used in Television before H.264. By the way, H.264 is also referred as MPEG-4.

### HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding, also called H.265).

H.265/HEVC is the standards-based successor to H.264/AVC that plays on many 4K TVs, OTT devices like Roku, and on latest Apple devices. Only Safari,and Microsoft Edge support HEVC, hence it is not used for streaming. H.265 is about twice as efficient as H.264, which is twice as efficient as H.262 (MPEG-2)

### VP9

An open-source (and royalty free) competitor to H.265, which delivers about the same quality as HEVC. Since playback is available in every browser but Safari, it's much more accessible than HEVC for streaming usage. VP stands for Video Processing, which went through VP7, VP8 and now VP9.
