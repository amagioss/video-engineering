# ðŸ“¦ Major Video Container Formats

## ðŸŽ¬ What is a Video Container?

A **video container** (or wrapper) is a file format that **bundles audio, video, subtitles, metadata**, and other data into a single file. Containers do **not compress** the media themselves â€” that's the job of **codecs** â€” but they define how that compressed data is **stored, synchronized, and played back**.

## ðŸ§  Key Considerations When Choosing a Container

- **Compatibility**: MP4 has the broadest support across platforms and browsers.
- **Subtitles**: MKV is great for multi-language tracks and rich subtitle formats.
- **Streaming**:
  - HLS prefers `.ts` or fragmented MP4 (`.m4s`)
  - MPEG-DASH supports `.mp4`, `.webm`, or CMAF
- **Editing**: MOV and MXF are used in professional post-production.

- **M2TS**: Blu-ray container format based on MPEG-TS.
- **FMP4 (Fragmented MP4)**: Used in CMAF workflows for low-latency streaming.
