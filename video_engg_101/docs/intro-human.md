## What is Video Engineering?

Video is undoubtedly the largest form of content consumed by humans on earth - do not look for the data and statistics for this claim. This is coming from the confidence that the world population is highest since humans started walking on earth and a large part of them spends more time watching video. Video content is consumed with different shades - enjoying, learning, collaborating, self expression, socialising; and now coming to what is video to engineers. So video engineering is what engineers see when there is video - it is not what is seen and heard from video, it is what is video under the hood. The different sections here will describe video from that angle and given the space is broad it will be focussed more on video on Broadcast TV and Streaming TV.

Any discussion about the video will start with compression, without which video would not have reached the places where it is reaching today. When we say High Definition video, it is about rectangle of  1920x1080 pixels, and with simple color space like RGB it will take 1920 × 1080 × 3 = 6,220,800 bytes (6.22 MB) for one frame of the video. Considering 30 frames that a human can process in a second, we are telling 180 MB for one second of video. So a hollywood movie of 90 minutes requires around 1008 GB (1 TB) to store or transmit. So we require **Video Compression** – Techniques like H.264, HEVC, and AV1 reduce video file sizes while maintaining quality.

How do we watch video from different places? That requires video to be carried over networks from the origin to viewers who watch through different medium - TV, mobile phone, computers. And this involves different requirements from display size to ability to handle large volume of data to different user tastes, and this leads to explosion of possible ways. There needs methods to serve video and to inter-operate with all middle elements. We have **Streaming Technologies** – Protocols like RTMP, HLS, and MPEG-DASH enable seamless video delivery over the internet, **Signal Processing** – Managing video signals for broadcast, production, and digital transmission. **Display and Rendering** – Understanding display resolutions, frame rates, HDR, and color spaces.

While video engineering is applicable to different industries like TV Broadcasting, Film/TV Production, Gaming, Virtual Reality, and Artificial Intelligence, we will focus on TV Broadcasting using traditional methods and internet.
