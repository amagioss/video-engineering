1. Try compressing a image buffer using own algorithm. It can be lossy or lossless.
E.g. Try the code [here](./vq_compression.py), by what factor is the image compressed?
How do I compare against the original image and output of png and jpeg? 

2. Calculate entropy of a gray image buffer. 

3. Try running https://github.com/mVirtuoso21/JPEG-Image-Compressor and understand the
principles behind image compression.

4. Given 2 consecutive frames of a video, find the best neighboring block in reference, subtract and reconstruct.

5. Compress a tone or drone sound generated in previous assignment using aac and mp3. 

6. Explore https://github.com/swesterfeld/audiowmark
